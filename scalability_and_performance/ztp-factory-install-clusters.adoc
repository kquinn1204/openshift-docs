Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for factory workflows accelerates the deployment of OpenShift with pre-certified hardware and software for rapid edge deployments.

ZTP for factory workflows, enables original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, to pre-install OpenShift at their factory and build turnkey solutions on their hardware. This approach is well-suited to a wide range of different industries from healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, to media, entertainment, retail, and telecommunications.

ZTP for factory workflows provides a way of installing on top of {product-title} the components that enable {product-title} to be used as a disconnected hub cluster. This hub cluster is then able to deploy edge clusters that can be shipped off site for final configuration.

At the factory setting the OEM partner first deploys a hub {product-title} cluster and then uses this to deploy one or more edge clusters at scale.

This compact {product-title} cluster hub uses {rh-rhacm-first} (ACM) and the assisted installer (AI) to install edge clusters at scale by using zero touch provisioning (ZTP).

When the edge cluster is installed it can be shipped to the customer on-premise locations and there the end customer unboxes it, and configures the edge cluster making it fully operational.

A high level overview of the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for factory workflows is as follows:

== Create the hub cluster

* Install the {product-title} hub cluster in a factory setting.
* Install OpenShift Data Foundation on the hub cluster.
* Install the factory pipeline tooling and pipeline
* Disconnect from the internet
* Create bootstrapping IP address pool

== Create and ship the edge cluster

* Create the edge cluster
* Connect the edge cluster
* Start the pipeline
* Disconnect the edge cluster

== Configure the edge cluster

* Configure the edge cluster on-site
* Connect the edge cluster to customer's on site network
* Configure the edge cluster
* Disconnect from customer's cluster network
* Configure site DNS for the edge cluster
