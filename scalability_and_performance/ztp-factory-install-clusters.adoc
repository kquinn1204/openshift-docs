Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for factory workflows accelerates the deployment of OpenShift with pre-certified hardware and software for rapid edge deployments.

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for factory workflows, enables original equipment manufacturers (OEM) partners to pre-install OpenShift at their factory and build turnkey solutions on their hardware. This approach is well-suited to a wide range of different industries from healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, to media and entertainment, retail and telecommunications and anywhere there is a need to run turnkey edge solutions at-scale.

ZTP for factory workflows deploys and delivers {product-title} clusters in a hub-and-spoke architecture using {product-title} GitOps deployment practices in combination with {product-title} pipelines to build an unattended deployment workflow for OpenShift clusters.

At the factory setting the OEM partner first deploys a hub {product-title} cluster and then uses this to deploy one or more spoke or turnkey edge clusters at scale.

This compact {product-title} cluster hub uses {rh-rhacm-first} (ACM) and the assisted installer (AI) to install spoke clusters at scale using zero touch provisioning (ZTP).

When the spoke cluster is installed it can be shipped to the customer on-premise locations and there the end customer unboxes it, and configures the spoke cluster with a number a scripts much like they would a home router.

A high level overview of the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for factory workflows is as follows:

== Create the hub cluster

* Install the {product-title} hub cluster in a "factory" setting.
* Install OpenShift Data Foundation on the hub cluster.
* Install the factory pipeline tooling and pipeline
* Disconnect from the internet
* Create bootstrapping IP address pool

== Create and ship the spoke cluster

* Create the spoke cluster
* Connect the spoke cluster
* Start the pipeline
* Disconnect the spoke cluster

== Configure the spoke cluster

* Configure the spoke cluster on-site
* Connect the spoke cluster to customer's on site network
* Configure the spoke cluster
* Disconnect from customer's cluster network
* Configure site DNS for the spoke cluster
