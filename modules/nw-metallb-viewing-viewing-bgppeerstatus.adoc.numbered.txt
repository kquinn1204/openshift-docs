     6	You can verify BGP advertisement status for your services by viewing the ServiceBGPStatus custom resource, which shows which BGP peers are receiving advertisements from each node. This is essential for debugging connectivity in Telco environments.
     7	
     8	The ServiceBGPStatus CR provides insights into which BGP peers a specific service is being advertised to from a given node. This is a crucial tool for network administrators in Telco environments to verify BGP advertisement and debug connectivity.
