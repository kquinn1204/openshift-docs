= Booting machines with the discovery ISO

To install {product-title} on the control plane, you must ensure the hosts boot from the discovery ISO. You can install from the ISO image burnt to disk or USB media or by using network PXE booting.

What method to use depends on your situation. A PXE install requires an available DHCP service and more preparation, but can make the installation process more automated. An install from the ISO burnt to USB media for example is a more manual process and can be inconvenient if you are setting up more than a few machines.
