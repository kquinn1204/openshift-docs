. Generate a discovery ISO. The discovery ISO is a live Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image that the nodes will boot from.
. Download a discovery ISO.
. Boot the hosts in the infrastructure cluster with that discovery ISO.
. When booted an introspection is performed by the discovery agent and data sent to the assisted service.
. The assisted installer interface guides the user through the {product-title} install.
. When everything is ready the user starts the cluster installation on the infrastructure cluster.
. Follow the same procedure steps 2 to 7 and start the cluster installation on the tenant cluster.
