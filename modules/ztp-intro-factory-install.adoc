= About the factory install pipeline

The factory install pipeline builds out your factory environment (hub and edge clusters) in readiness for the edge cluster to be shipped off site. Red Hat has created a set of community scripts available in a GitHub repository to help you with this task.

With a correctly configured hub cluster, you can provision many {product-title} edge clusters in a factory-type setting. RHACM manages clusters in a hub and edge architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many edge clusters. A hub cluster running RHACM provisions and deploys the edge clusters using ZTP and Assisted Installer (AI). AI provisions {product-title} on the bare-metal edge clusters.
