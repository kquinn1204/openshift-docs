= An introduction to the factory install pipeline

The factory install pipeline builds out your factory environment (hub and edge clusters) in readiness for the edge cluster to be shipped off-site. Red Hat has created a set of community scripts to help you get started with this task.

A GitHub repo contains all the relevant scripts and YAML files you need to provision the hub cluster and edge clusters.

The edge cluster installation uses a zero touch provisioning (ZTP) approach facilitated by {rh-rhacm-first} using the Assisted Installer (AI) installed as part of running the factory install pipeline.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision many {product-title} edge clusters in a factory-type setting. ACM manages clusters in a hub and edge architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many edge clusters. A hub cluster running ACM provisions and deploys the edge clusters using ZTP and AI.. The AI service handles provisioning of {product-title} of the edge clusters running on bare metal.
