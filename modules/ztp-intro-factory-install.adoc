= An introduction to the factory install pipeline

The factory install pipeline builds out your factory environment (hub and edge clusters) in readiness for the edge cluster to be shipped off-site. Red Hat has created a set of community scripts to help you get started with this task.

All the relevant scripts and YAML files needed to factory provision the hub and edge cluster are included in a GitHub repo.

The edge cluster installation uses a zero touch provisioning (ZTP) approach facilitated by {rh-rhacm-first} using the assisted installer (AI) installed as part of running the factory install pipeline.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision many {product-title} edge clusters in a factory-type setting. ACM manages clusters in a hub and edge architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many edge clusters. A hub cluster running ACM provision and deploys the edge clusters by using ZTP and AI. The AI service handles provisioning of {product-title} of the edge compact clusters (3 control plane nodes and 1 worker node) running on bare metal.
