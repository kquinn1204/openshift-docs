= Generating the discovery ISO with the Assisted Installer

Installing {product-title} `x86_64` tenant cluster (3 Control plane nodes and 3 workers nodes) requires a discovery ISO, which the Assisted Installer (AI) can generate with the cluster name, base domain, Secure Shell (SSH) public key, and pull secret.
[NOTE]
====
In the intitial install you are only installing the control plane nodes.
====


Use the Assisted Installer to create a discovery ISO for the `x86_64` tenant cluster. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index:[Assisted Installer for {product-title}] documentation for details on using the Assisted Installer.

Once you have downloaded the discovery ISO boot the tenant cluster control plane nodes with the discovery image. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/assembly_booting-hosts-with-the-discovery-image[Booting hosts with the discovery image for additional details].
