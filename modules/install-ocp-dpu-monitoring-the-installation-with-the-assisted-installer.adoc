= Monitoring the installation with the Assisted Installer

Use this procedure to monitor the installation and assign roles to the nodes in the tenant cluster.

.Procedure

. On the installer node, return to the browser and refresh the page. 

. Select the cluster name.

. Click *Next* to reach the *Host discovery* screen. It should now be populated with your cluster hosts. 

. Under *Role* assign 3 control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes. 

. Click *Next* until you reach step 3, *Networking*.

. Choose *Cluster-Managed Networking*.

. Select a subnet from the available subnets.

. Create an *API Virtual IP*. This IP must be in the available subnet range.

. Create an *Ingress Virtual IP*. This IP must be in the available subnet range.

. Set *Network type* to *Open Virtual Networking*.

. Keep *Use the same host discovery SSH key* checked. You can change the SSH public key, if necessary.

. Click *Next* to proceed to the *Review and create* step.

. Click *Install cluster*.

. Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the discovery image to the servers drive, the servers in the cluster will restart. If you installed by using USB drive or PXE boot reset the BIOS on the servers in the cluster to boot to the servers' local media rather than the USB drive. 

The servers will restart several times, deploying the control plane.
