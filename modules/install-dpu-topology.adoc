= OpenShift and DPU deployment architecture

The proposed deployment architecture is a two-cluster design. In this architecture, DPU cards are provisioned as worker nodes of the ARM-based infrastructure cluster. The tenant cluster, composed of the x86 servers, is where the normal user applications run. The following diagram illustrates the deployment architecture.

[NOTE]
====
The installation of this infrastructure cluster can be on ARM hardware or a mixed environment of x86 control plane and ARM worker nodes.

The steps involved in deploying and configuring are:

. Install the infrastructure cluster by using the assisted installer.
.. Install 3 control plane nodes and at least 2 DPU worker nodes.
. Install the control plane nodes of the tenant cluster by using the assisted installer.
. Install the DPU Network Operator on the infrastructure cluster.
.. Partially configure the DPU Network Operator effectively making it aware of the attached DPU.
. Configure support for hardware offloading in the infrastructure cluster.
. Configure support for hardware offloading in the tenant cluster.
.. Enable the SR-IOV Network Operator on the hosts with DPU mode.
. Add worker nodes to the tenant cluster.
. Final infrastructure configuration.
