= Intel IPU and OpenShift architecture

The high-level architecture associated with the integration of IntelÂ® IPU E2000 Series with Red Hat OpenShift, shown in the following diagram, is designed for performance at scale under real world workloads and opens up a wide array of use cases through the ability to flexibly service chain network functions at the edge.

The architecture integrates {product-title} running the DPU Operator which deploys the DPU daemon onto worker nodes that interface through an API controlling the DPU daemon running on the IPU. The DPU Operator is responsible for the life-cycle management of the `ovn-kube` components and the necessary host network initialization on the IPU.

The IPU at a high level is organized into an IPU management console (IMC) compute complex and a compute complex built on Arm architecture. One of the key components illustrated is the flexible programmable packet processing engine (FPPE) for vSwitch offload. This FPPE facilitates service function chaining enabling more services to be offloaded to the IPU. Resource intensive packet processing workflows can be executed on the IPU and network functions like firewalls, packet filtering and compression can be chained to deliver complex services with the added benefit of freeing up valuable CPU resources.

The ARM compute complex (ACC) running MicroShift on RHEL gives you access to all the normal Red Hat manageability tools for free. The IPU is treated just like any other server and can be managed effortlessly using the same familiar tools as any other component in your infrastructure.
