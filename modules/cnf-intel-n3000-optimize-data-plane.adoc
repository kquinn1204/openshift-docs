= Understanding the vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100

Hardware accelerators cards from Intel® play a key role in accelerating 4G/LTE and 5G Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN) workloads, which in turn increases the overall compute capacity of a commercial, off-the-shelf platform.

The vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100, based on the Intel eASIC technology is designed to offload and accelerate the computing-intensive process of forward error correction (FEC) for 4G/LTE and 5G technology, freeing up processing power.
Intel eASIC™ devices are structured ASICs, an intermediate technology between field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and standard Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).

These devices provide lower unitcost and lower power compared to FPGAs and faster time to market and lower non-recurring engineering cost compared to standard- ASICs.

Intel vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100 support on OpenShift is facilitated with the OpenNESS Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators.
