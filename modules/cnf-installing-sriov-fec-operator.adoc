= Installing the OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators

The role of the OpenNESS Operator for Intel Wireless Forward Error Correction (FEC) Accelerator is to orchestrate and manage the devices exposed by a range of Intel vRAN FEC acceleration hardware within the {product-title} cluster.

One of the most compute-intensive 4G/LTE and 5G workloads is RAN layer 1 (L1) forward error correction (FEC), which resolves data transmission errors over unreliable or noisy communication channels. FEC technology detects and corrects a limited number of errors in 4G/LTE or 5G data without the need for retransmission.

The FEC device is provided by the IntelÂ® vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100 for the vRAN use case.

The SR-IOV FEC Operator provides functionality to create desired virtual functions (VFs) for the FEC device, binds them to appropriate drivers, and configures the VFs queues for desired functionality in 4G/LTE or 5G deployment.

As a cluster administrator, you can install the OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators by using the {product-title} CLI or the web console.

== Installing the SR-IOV FEC Operator by using the CLI

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator by using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster installed on bare metal hardware.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a namespace for the SR-IOV FEC Operator by completing the following actions:

.. Define the `vran-acceleration-operators` namespace by creating a file named `sriov-namespace.yaml` as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
    name: vran-acceleration-operators
    labels:
       openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
----

.. Create the namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-namespace.yaml
----

. Install the SR-IOV FEC Operator in the namespace you created in the previous step by creating the following objects:

.. Create the following `OperatorGroup` CR and save the YAML in the `sriov-operatorgroup.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
    name: vran-operators
    namespace: vran-acceleration-operators
spec:
    targetNamespaces:
      - vran-acceleration-operators
----

.. Create the `OperatorGroup` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-operatorgroup.yaml
----


.. Run the following command to get the `channel` value required for the next step.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifest sriov-operator -n openshift-marketplace -o jsonpath='{.status.defaultChannel}'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
stable
----

.. Create the following `Subscription` CR and save the YAML in the `sriov-sub.yaml` file:
+
.Example Subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
    name: sriov-fec-subscription
    namespace: vran-acceleration-operators
spec:
    channel: "<channel>" <1>
    name: sriov-fec
    source: certified-operators <2>
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
<1> Specify the value for channel from the value obtained in the previous step for the `.status.defaultChannel` parameter.
<2> You must specify the `certified-operators` value.

.. Create the `Subscription` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f sriov-sub.yaml
----

.. Verify that the Operator is installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -n vran-acceleration-operators -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Name                                        Phase
sriov-fec.v1.1.0                            Succeeded
----

.. Change to the `vran-acceleration-operators` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project vran-acceleration-operators
----

[id="installing-openness-sriov-fec-operator-using-web-console_{context}"]
== Installing the OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators by using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators by using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
You must create the `Namespace` and `OperatorGroup` CR as mentioned in the previous section.
====

.Procedure

. Install the OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators by using the {product-title} web console:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose *OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, select *All namespaces on the cluster*. Then, click *Install*.

. Optional: Verify that the SRIOV-FEC Operator installed successfully:

.. Switch to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *OpenNESS SR-IOV Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators* is listed in the *vran-acceleration-operators* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====
+
If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*.
* Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the `vran-acceleration-operators` project.
