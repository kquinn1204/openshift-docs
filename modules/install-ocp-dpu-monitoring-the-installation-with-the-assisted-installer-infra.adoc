= Monitoring the installation with the Assisted Installer

Use this procedure to monitor the installation in the infrastructure cluster.

.Procedure

. On the installer node, return to the browser and refresh the page.

. Select the cluster name.

. Click *Next* to reach the Host discovery screen. It should now be populated with your three control plane hosts.

. Click *Next* until you reach step 3, *Networking*.

. Choose *Cluster-Managed Networking*.

. Select a subnet from the available subnets.

. Create an *API Virtual IP*. This IP must be in the available subnet range.

. Create an *Ingress Virtual IP*. This IP must be in the available subnet range.

. Set *Network type* to *Open Virtual Networking*

. Click *Next* to proceed to the *Review and create* step.

. Click *Install cluster*. The install completes in about 30 to 40 minutes.

. Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the discovery image to the servers drive, the servers in the cluster will restart. If you installed using USB drive or PXE boot reset the BIOS on the servers in the cluster to boot to the servers' local media rather than the USB drive.

The servers will restart several times, deploying the control plane. Upon completion of this stage you should {product-title} running on the control plane nodes of the infrastructure cluster.
