= Manual migration to new customDeploy install method

A new deployment method introduced in 4.10 allows you to customize the network configuration (`networkConfig`) in the `install-config.yaml` file by host during the install and provisioning process. You can also set static IPs per host and additional advanced network configurations.

When you upgrade to {product-title} 4.10, the new deployment method is not automatically upgraded and therefore you need to perform the following manual steps.
