== Installing the DPU Network Operator using the CLI

The DPU Network Operator on the infrastructure cluster side is responsible for the life-cycle management of the `ovn-kube` components and the necessary host network initialization on DPU cards.

.Prerequisites

* An infrastructure cluster composed of `x86` control plane and ARM worker nodes are up and running.
* An tenant cluster composed of `x86` control plane nodes.
* DPU cards installed on the worker nodes of the infrastructure cluster where hardware offloading need to be enabled.
* Pods in the infrastructure cluster can reach the API server of the tenant cluster
* Network configuration:
  - The infrastructure cluster and the tenant cluster share the same VLAN as the API network.
  - The two clusters shall use different VIPs as the cluster API VIP.
  - The DHCP server needs to be configured to be able to assign IP addresses to hosts from both clusters from the same subnet.
  - The DNS server shall be able to resolve the URI to the API URL for both the clusters.

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to infrastructure cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the `openshift-dpu-network-operator` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace openshift-dpu-network-operator
----

. Create the following Subscription CR and save the YAML in the `dpu-sub.yaml` file:
+
.Example Subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-dpu-operator-subscription
  namespace: openshift-dpu-network-operator
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  name: dpu-network-operator
  source: redhat-operators <1>
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
+
<1> You must specify the `redhat-operators` value.

. Create the Subscription object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f dpu-sub.yaml
----

. Change to the `openshift-dpu-network-operator` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-dpu-network-operator
----

. Verify the DPU Network Operator is running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-dpu-network-operator
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
