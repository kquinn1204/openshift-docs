= Factory install workflow

Creating a factory install pipeline involves initially creating an appropriately configured hub cluster and then using it to deploy multiple edge clusters.

This first part of creating a factory install pipeline involves deploying the hub cluster configuration. The assumption being {product-title} and optionally OpenShift Data Foundation is installed with persistent volumes created with supporting DHCP and DNS configuration.
This second part deploys relocatable edge clusters on the preferred hardware in parallel by using the hub cluster. When the deployment completes, the hardware where the edge cluster is installed is shipped to the end customer. The end customer runs some on site configuration steps and then has a fully operational {product-title} cluster.
