= The hub and edge cluster architecture

At the end of running all workflows in the hub and edge cluster pipelines the architecture for a compact hub and 3 plus 1 edge cluster resembles the following:

.Hub and spoke architecture

Every blade in the chassis has access to multiple NICs, which are connected to internal switches. Switches and NICs are referred to as networks using the name of the interface. The `eno4` and `eno5` networks, are 10gbs networks with enough bandwidth to support the internal and external traffic of the cluster. Both networks are L2.
The `eno4` network is used as the external network. It will be configured by DHCP, to make it easier for the factory to configure and interact with it. This also simplifies the on site customer configuration.
The `eno5` network is the internal network. It is only be accessible from within the blades. This network is configured with static IPs and is expected to be used only for the internal traffic of the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The network interface names `eno4` and `eno5` are configurable in the `spokes.yaml` file.
