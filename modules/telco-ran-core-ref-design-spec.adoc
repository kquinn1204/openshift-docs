= Reference design scope

The {rds} reference design specification captures the recommended, tested, and supported configurations to get reliable and repeatable performance for a cluster running the {rds} profile.

The reference design includes the released features and supported configurations that are engineered and validated for clusters to run the {rds} profile.
The configurations provide a baseline {product-title} installation that meets feature and KPI targets.
The reference design also describes expected variations for each individual configuration.

Validation of the reference design includes many long duration and at-scale tests.

[NOTE]
====
The validated reference configuration is updated for each major Y-stream release of {product-title}.
Z-stream patch releases are periodically re-tested against the reference configuration.
Testing includes many long-duration validations.
