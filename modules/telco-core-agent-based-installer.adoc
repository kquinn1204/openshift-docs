= Agent-based installer

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release.

Description::
Telco core clusters can be installed using the Agent-based Installer.
This method allows you to install OpenShift on bare-metal servers without requiring additional servers or VMs for managing the installation.
The Agent-based Installer can be run on any system (for example, from a laptop) to generate an ISO installation image.
The ISO is used as the installation media for the cluster supervisor nodes.
Progress can be monitored using the Agent-based Installer from any system with network connectivity to the supervisor node's API interfaces.

Agent-based Installer supports the following:

* Installation from declarative CRs
* Installation in disconnected environments
* No additional servers required to support installation, for example, the bastion node is not longer needed

Limits and requirements::
* Disconnected installation requires a registry with all required content mirrored that is reachable from the installed host.

Engineering considerations::
* Networking configuration should be applied as NMState configuration during installation as opposed to Day 2 configuration using the NMState Operator.
