= {rh-storage}

New in this release::
* Clarification on internal versus external mode and RDS recommendations.

Description::
{rh-storage} is a software-defined storage service for containers.
{rh-storage} can be deployed in one of two modes:
* Internal mode, where {rh-storage} software components are deployed as software containers directly on the OpenShift cluster nodes, together with other containerized applications.
* External mode, where {rh-storage} is deployed on a dedicated storage cluster, which is usually a separate Red Hat Ceph Storage cluster running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
These storage services are running externally to the application workload cluster.

For telco core clusters, storage support is provided by {rh-storage} storage services running in external mode, for several reasons:

* Separating dependencies between OpenShift and Ceph operations allows for independent OpenShift and {rh-storage} updates.
* Separation of operations functions for the Storage and OpenShift infrastructure layers, is a typical customer requirement for telco core use cases.
* "External Red Hat Ceph Storage clusters can be re-used by multiple OpenShift clusters deployed in the same region.

{rh-storage} supports separation of storage traffic using secondary CNI networks.

Limits and requirements::
* In an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking environment, {rh-storage} uses IPv4 addressing.
For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.19/html/planning_your_deployment/network-requirements_rhodf#ipv6-support_rhodf[IPv6 support].

Engineering considerations::
* {rh-storage} network traffic should be isolated from other traffic on a dedicated network, for example, by using VLAN isolation.
* Workload requirements must be scoped before attaching multiple OpenShift clusters to an external {rh-storage} cluster to ensure sufficient throughput, bandwidth, and performance KPIs.
