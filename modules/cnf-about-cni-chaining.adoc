= About CNI chaining

Chaining CNI plugins is a powerful feature for advanced networking use cases, enabling Pods to be configured with multiple network interfaces and fine-grained traffic routing policies. This allows for the implementation of complex network topologies, such as multi-network applications in Telco environments that require traffic isolation and prioritized routing.

By using CNI plugin chaining, different types of traffic can be isolated to meet performance, security, and compliance requirements, providing greater flexibility in network design and traffic management.

Some scenarios where this might be useful include:

* *Multi-Network topologies*: You may need to attach pods to multiple networks, each with its own traffic policy.
* *Traffic isolation*: Separate networks for management, storage, and application traffic to ensure each has the appropriate security and QoS settings.
* *Custom routing rules*: Specific traffic for example SIP traffic should always use a designated network interface, while other traffic follows the default network.
* *Enhanced network performance*: Prioritize certain traffic types or manage congestion by directing them through dedicated network interfaces.
