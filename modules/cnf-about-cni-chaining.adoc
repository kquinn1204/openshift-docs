= About CNI chaining

Chaining CNI plugins is a powerful feature for advanced networking use cases, enabling Pods to be configured with multiple network interfaces and fine-grained traffic routing policies. This allows for the implementation of complex network topologies, such as multi-network applications in Telco environments that require traffic isolation and prioritized routing.

By using CNI plugin chaining, different types of traffic can be isolated to meet performance, security, and compliance requirements, providing greater flexibility in network design and traffic management.
