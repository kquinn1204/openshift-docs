= Configuring plugin chaining with Multus CNI

Plugin chaining allows you to configure multiple CNI plugins to be applied sequentially to the same network interface. This approach is useful when you need to implement complex network configurations, such as routing traffic over different network paths or creating isolated networks for specialized traffic types.

For instance, in a telco environment, you may have the following requirements:

* SIP traffic (Voice over IP) must always be routed over a dedicated SIP network for optimized performance.
* Management traffic must go over a separate management network for administrative purposes.

Consider a telco application where SIP (telephony) traffic must be isolated from other types of traffic for example management or data traffic. This requires two networks:

* SIP Network: Handles all telephony traffic to ensure quality of service (QoS) and low latency.
* Management Network: Handles administrative traffic such as monitoring and configuration.

In this case, you can configure a pod with two interfaces:

* `eth1` for management traffic, routed through the management network.
* `eth2` for SIP traffic, routed through the SIP network.

Following this example you can use plugin chaining with Multus CNI, to attach both interfaces to the pod and use source-based routing to ensure SIP traffic is only routed through `eth2` while all other traffic flows over eth1.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* An account with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file, such as `chained.yaml`, to define a chained NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD) that configures two additional interfaces, `eth1` and `eth2`, with the following configuration:

<1> The first plugin is a `macvlan` plugin that creates a new interface for example the management interface `eth1` with a static IP address.
<2> The `master` field specifies the parent interface to attach the new interface to.
<3> Pods will be assigned an IP from the 192.168.100.0/24 range.
<4> The `gateway` field specifies the gateway IP address for the new interface.
<5> The second plugin is a `macvlan` plugin that creates a new interface for example the SIP interface `eth2` with a static IP address.
<6> The `master` field specifies the parent interface to attach the new interface to.
<7> Pods will be assigned an IP from the 10.0.0.0/24 range.
<8> The `gateway` field specifies the gateway IP address for the new interface.
<9> The third plugin is a `route-override` plugin that sets the default route for the pod to use the `eth1` interface. The `route-override` plugin ensures non-SIP traffic is routed via the management network.

.  Attach the NAD to a pod by creating a Pod definition file, such as `pod.yaml`, with the following configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: telco-app-pod
  namespace: telco-app
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: '[{ "name": "chained-net" }]'
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: centos/tools
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]

.Verification

. Run the following command to list all network interfaces and their assigned IP addresses inside the `telco-app-pod`. This will help verify that the pod has multiple network interfaces configured as expected:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it telco-app-pod -n telco-app -- ip a
----

. Run the following command to inspect the IP routing rules inside the `telco-app-pod`. This will display the source-based routing rules applied within the pod to ensure SIP traffic is routed through `eth2`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it telco-app-pod -n telco-app -- ip rule show
----

. Run the following command to view the routing table (Table 200) inside the `telco-app-pod`. This will help verify that traffic destined for the SIP network is correctly routed according to the source-based routing rules:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it telco-app-pod -n telco-app -- ip route show table 200
----

. Run the following command to send an HTTP HEAD request to sip-server.example.com from the telco-app-pod, explicitly using the eth2 interface. This helps verify that SIP traffic is correctly routed through the designated network interface:
+
[source,terminal]   
----
$ oc exec -it telco-app-pod -n telco-app -- curl -I --interface eth2 sip-server.example.com
----

. Run the following command to send an HTTP HEAD request to example.com from the telco-app-pod, explicitly using the eth1 interface. This helps verify that non-SIP traffic is correctly routed through the management network:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it telco-app-pod -n telco-app -- curl -I --interface eth1 example.com
----

The first command should return a response from the SIP server, while the second command should return a response from the default server.
