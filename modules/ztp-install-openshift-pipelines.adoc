= Installing the OpenShift Pipelines Operator

Follow this guidance to install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator that is used to run the pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* An installed {product-title} hub cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Install `git`. For guidance on installing `git`, see link:https://github.com/git-guides/install-git[Install Git].

.Procedure

. Export the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<path_to_kubeconfig>/kubeconfig
----

. Run the following bash script `bootstrap.sh` with the `KUBECONFIG` as a parameter to install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sLK https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/main/pipelines/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- ${KUBECONFIG}
----
+
This script:

* Installs the `tkn` CLI. This tool manages {product-title} pipelines from a terminal.
* Clones the link:https://github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable[ztp-pipeline-relocatable] pipeline repository.
* Checks that the correct permissions are set on the hub cluster.
* Deploys the OpenShift Pipelines Operator from the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog.
* Deploys the ZTP pipeline and associated tasks.

. Monitor the progress in the terminal window and in the web console.

.. In the terminal window you are expected to see the following:
