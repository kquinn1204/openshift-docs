= Service mesh

Description::
Telco core cloud-native functions (CNFs) typically require a service mesh implementation.
Specific service mesh features and performance requirements are dependent on the application.
The selection of service mesh implementation and configuration is outside the scope of this documentation.
You must account for the impact of service mesh on cluster resource usage and performance, including additional latency introduced in pod networking, in your implementation.
