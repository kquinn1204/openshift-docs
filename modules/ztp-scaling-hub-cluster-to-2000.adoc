= Scaling to 2000 cluster deployments

Scalability limitiations come from the ability of the ArgoCD application to manage the generated CRs and of ACM to managed the clusters.
In 4.10 improvements have been made to help address scalability concerns for example: 

* When you upgrade to 4.10, or if you are installing 4.10 ZTP solution for the first time, applying the “deployment” directory configures the ArgoCD application to scale.
* The 4.10 reference PolicyGenTemplates combine multiple configuration CRs into relatively few policies. The reduced number of policies improves scaling of the hub cluster.
* The 4.10 ZTP solution uses a improved internal structure for generating the installation and configuration CRs which improves scalability. When you follow the installation/upgrade instructions these improvements are automatically pulled in and no additional action is needed.

The recommended ZTP structure defines several categories of configuration, denoted common, group, and site-specific. The common and group categories define once a set of configuration which applies to multiple clusters. This results in relatively fewer configuration CRs which need to be managed by the hub cluster which in turn improves scalability.
The recommendation is to put CRs into common or group rather than site-specific when the config applies to multiple clusters.

The DU configuration is governed by the following RAN policies: 

**Common** 
A set of policies that apply to all 2000 nodes containing at least five policies.

**Group**
 A set of policies that apply to a subset of the 2000 nodes. There should be at least two groups containing at least seven policies per group.

**Sites**
A set of policies that apply to only one node. There should be 2000 sets of these policies, each containing at least six policies.
