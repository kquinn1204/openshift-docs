     7	= Understanding MetalLB status custom resources
     8	
     9	[role="_abstract"]
    10	You can gain insights into MetalLB's operational status through custom resources that expose IP address allocation, L2 advertisement status, and BGP session details for your load-balancer services.
    11	
    12	MetalLB exposes status information for several key components, providing a comprehensive view of its configuration and operation:
    13	
    14	* *`IPAddressPool` Status*: Shows the allocation and availability of IP addresses within a defined pool.
    15	* *`ServiceL2Status`*: Indicates the status of L2 advertisements for services.
    16	* *`ServiceBGPStatus`*: Provides details on the status of BGP sessions for services. This is particularly important for Telco environments.
    17	
    18	The MetalLB controller, typically deployed as `metallb-system/controller`, is responsible for managing IP address assignments and updating the `IPAddressPool` status. When a service requests a LoadBalancer IP, the controller allocates an IP from an appropriate `IPAddressPool` and updates the status fields to reflect the current number of assigned and available IP addresses.
