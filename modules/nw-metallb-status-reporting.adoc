= Understanding MetalLB status custom resources

[role="_abstract"]
You can gain insights into MetalLB's operational status through custom resources that expose IP address allocation, L2 advertisement status, and BGP session details for your load-balancer services.

MetalLB exposes status information for several key components, providing a comprehensive view of its configuration and operation:

* *`IPAddressPool` Status*: Shows the allocation and availability of IP addresses within a defined pool.
* *`ServiceL2Status`*: Indicates the status of L2 advertisements for services.
* *`ServiceBGPStatus`*: Provides details on the status of BGP sessions for services. This is particularly important for Telco environments.

The MetalLB controller, typically deployed as `metallb-system/controller`, is responsible for managing IP address assignments and updating the `IPAddressPool` status. When a service requests a LoadBalancer IP, the controller allocates an IP from an appropriate `IPAddressPool` and updates the status fields to reflect the current number of assigned and available IP addresses.
