= Adding worker nodes to the tenant cluster

Use this procedure to add worker nodes to the tenant cluster by generating a new discovery ISO.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[console.redhat.com/openshift].

. From the list of created clusters find your created tenant cluster.

. Select your tenant cluster.

. Click the `Add hosts` button and select the installation media.

.. Select `Minimal image file: Provision with virtual media` to download a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot. The nodes must have virtual media capability. This is the recommended method.

.. Select `Full image file: Provision with physical` media to download the larger full image.

.. Select `iPXE: Provision from your network server`. Use this when you have an iPXE server that has already been setup.

. Add an SSH public key so that you can connect to the cluster nodes as the `core` user. Having a login to the cluster nodes can provide you with debugging information during the installation.

. Optional: If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, select Configure cluster-wide proxy settings. Enter the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

. Optional: Configure cluster-wide trusted certificate if needed. If the cluster hosts are in a network with a re-encrypting (MITM) proxy or the cluster needs to trust certificates for other purposes (e.g. container image registries).

. Click `Generate Discovery ISO`.

. Download the discovery ISO.

. Boot the tenant cluster worker host(s) with the discovery image.
