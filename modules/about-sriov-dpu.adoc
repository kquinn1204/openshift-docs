= About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks

The Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) specification is a standard for a type of PCI device assignment that can share a single device with multiple pods.

SR-IOV can segment a compliant network device, recognized on the host node as a physical function (PF), into multiple virtual functions (VFs).
The VF is used like any other network device.
The SR-IOV network device driver for the device determines how the VF is exposed in the container:

* `netdevice` driver: A regular kernel network device in the `netns` of the container
* `vfio-pci` driver: A character device mounted in the container

Install the SR-IOV Network Operator to the tenant cluster.
