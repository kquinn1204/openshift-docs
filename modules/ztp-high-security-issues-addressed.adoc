= Security issues addressed

== Issue 1: Disable USB boot, wireless and bluetooth access  

To prevent unauthorized modifications to the operating system and to reduce the risk of physical attack vectors, disable USB boot, wireless and bluetooth in the BIOS settings. These setting are not controlled through ZTP configuration. For example disabling USB boot prevents attackers from booting from a USB drive and gaining unauthorized access to the system. The recommended firmware configuration is described in "Chapter 6. Configuring host firmware for low latency nad high performance".

== Issue 2: Disable Ctrl+Alt+Del reboots
 
Disabling CtrlAltDelBurstAction and Ctrl+Alt+Del prevents unauthorized reboots.

== Issue 3:  Restrict SSH access
  
Limit direct SSH access to {product-title} by disabling root login. 

== Issue 4:   Prevent login to accounts with empty passwords
  
Enforce strict authentication policies by disabling logins for accounts without passwords, ensuring compliance with security best practices and reducing unauthorized access risks.

== Ensure that the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege

To minimize the risk of unauthorized access, ensure that the RBAC setup as described in "Chapter 8. Using RBAC to define and apply permissions" follows the principle of least privilege, granting users the minimum required permissions. 

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} provides the tools for creating minimal permissions, you need to assess the needs of users and services within your environment and apply the principle of least privilege accordingly.
====

For example you might consider creating:

* A role with minimal permissions to control user access, such as granting users the ability to view resources without modifying them.
* A role that allows developers to manage only deployments and services within a specific namespace, without granting access to sensitive resources 
* A role for users who need to view configuration resources, such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`, but not change them.

[NOTE]
====
Regularly review and update permissions to ensure that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
