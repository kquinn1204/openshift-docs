= Security hardening measures implemented

== Disabling USB boot, wireless and bluetooth access  

To prevent unauthorized modifications to the operating system and to reduce the risk of physical attack vectors, USB boot, wireless, and Bluetooth are disabled in the BIOS settings. These setting are not controlled through ZTP configuration. For example, disabling USB boot prevents attackers from booting from a USB drive and gaining unauthorized access to the system. The recommended firmware configuration is described in "Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance".

== Preventing unauthorized Reboots
 
Disabling `CtrlAltDelBurstAction` and `Ctrl+Alt+Del` prevents unauthorized reboots.

== Restricting direct SSH access
  
Direct SSH access to {product-title} is limited by disabling `root` login.

== Adhering to the principle of least privilege with RBAC
  
Enforce strict authentication policies by disabling logins for accounts without passwords, ensuring compliance with security best practices and reducing unauthorized access risks.

== Ensure that the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege

To minimize the risk of unauthorized access, the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege, as described in "Using RBAC to define and apply permissions", granting users the minimum required permissions. 

{product-title} provides the tools for creating minimal permissions. However, you need to assess the needs of users and services within your environment and apply the principle of least privilege accordingly.

For example, consider creating a role that:

* Provides permissions to control user access, such as granting users the ability to view resources without modifying them.
* Enables developers to manage only deployments and services within a specific namespace, without granting access to sensitive resources. 
* Allows users to view configuration resources, such as `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`, but not change them.

Regularly review and update permissions to ensure that users have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
