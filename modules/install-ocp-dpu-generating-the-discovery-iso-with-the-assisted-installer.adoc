= Generating the discovery ISOs with the Assisted Installer for the infrastructure nodes

Installing {product-title} infrastructure cluster (3 Control plane nodes and 3 worker nodes) requires the creation of two discovery ISOs. YOU can use the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[Assisted Installer] UI or the API to create discovery ISOs for both `x86_64` and `arm64`.

See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index:[Assisted Installer for {product-title}] documentation for details on using the Assisted Installer.

When installing using the UI and setting the cluster details in the dropdown menu associated with the OpenShift version select an {product-title} version with the `-multi` extension for example `{product-tile} {product-version}-multi`. Follow the installation instructions, and for the control plane nodes, choose 'x86_64' as the `CPU architecture` from the dropdown menu, and proceed to download the discovery ISO. For the worker nodes, choose 'arm64' as the CPU architecture and follow the instructions to download a second discovery ISO.

A summary of the steps relevant to installing a multi architecture using the Assisted Installer API are as follows:

. Register a new cluster setting the `openshift_version` to install `{product-tile} {product-version}-multi`.
. Register a new infrastructure environment setting the `cpu_architecture` to `x86_64` and proceed to download the discovery ISO. For the worker nodes, set `arm64` as the `cpu_architecture` and follow the instructions to download a second discovery ISO.

[NOTE]
====
You need to create two infrastructure environments.

After completing this stage you will have two discovery ISOs. Boot the `x86_64` control plane nodes following the standard boot procedure appropriate for your environment described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/assembly_booting-hosts-with-the-discovery-image[Booting hosts with the discovery image for additional details].
