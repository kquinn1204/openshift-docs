= OpenShift and DPU deployment architecture

To ease the management of DPUs, the architecture is a two-cluster design. In this architecture, DPU cards are provisioned as worker nodes of the ARM-based infrastructure cluster. The tenant cluster composed of the x86 servers is where the normal user applications run. The following diagram illustrates the deployment architecture.

The steps involved in deploying and configuring the deployment are:

. Install the RHEL installer node with Podman OpenShift Assisted Installer
. Install three infrastructure control plane nodes (can be VMs) and three DPU (assuming same L2) on ARM
. Install three tenant control plane nodes and three x86 hosts
. Install the DPU Network Operator on the infrastructure cluster
. Enable SR-IOV Operator on the hosts with DPU mode
