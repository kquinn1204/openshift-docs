= Installing the infrastructure cluster

Use the Assisted Installer to install {product-title} on the infrastructure cluster running on multi architecture with the control plane nodes running on `x86_64` and the worker nodes running on ARM architecture. The infrastructure cluster both the control plane and worker nodes can run on ARM architecture.
[NOTE]
====
The infrastructure cluster should use the DPU's uplink network as the primary network and not the out-of-band management network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Shared VLAN: The Assisted Installer requires all nodes to be present on the same VLAN. This is a requirement of utilizing a virtual IP for both ingress and API.
* DHCP: Much like an installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installation DHCP is required in the VLAN.
* DNS: Records for ingress and API are required for accessing the cluster.
