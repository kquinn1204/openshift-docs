Traditional NICs and monolithic virtual machines struggle with increasing network speeds and evolving microservices architectures. Intel® IPU and {product-title} address these challenges by:

* Offloading network and security processing to optimize CPU usage.
* Enhancing security with hardware isolation.
* Enabling low-latency, high-performance workloads at the edge.

Network Function Chaining (NFC) allows for efficient, secure execution of network services at the edge. The IPU’s P4-programmable processing engine offloads packet processing, freeing {product-title} worker nodes for business logic execution while optimizing resource utilization.
Intel® IPU integrates with {product-title} management tools and supports Redfish-based provisioning for automated infrastructure deployment. {product-title} security policies enforce container protection, automated compliance, and workload isolation.

The integration of {product-title} with Intel® IPU enhances network infrastructure by improving application performance, security, and efficiency. This combination supports modern workloads requiring high-speed networking, low-latency processing, and scalable cloud-native deployment.
