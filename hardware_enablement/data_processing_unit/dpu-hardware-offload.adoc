:FeatureName: Open Virtual Network (OVN) offloading with {product-title} on NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

Learn how to accelerate and offload software subsystems using {product-title} and the Data Processing Unit (DPU). DPUs are a class of reprogrammable high-performance processors combined with high-performance network interfaces optimized to perform and accelerate network and storage functions carried out by data center servers.
The Data Processing Unit (DPU) is a complete compute system with an independent software stack, network identity, and provisioning capabilities. The DPU is fully capable of hosting its own applications by using embedded or orchestrated deployment models.

The unique capabilities of the DPU are disruptive because they allow for key infrastructure functions and their associated software stacks, to be completely removed from the host node’s CPU cores and to be relocated onto the DPU.

Open Virtual Network flow offload is only supported on {product-title} 4.10.

== Installing and configuring an accelerated infrastructure with OpenShift and DPUs

Installing {product-title} on a DPU makes it possible to offload packet processing from the host `x86` to the DPU. Offloading resource-intensive computational tasks, such as packet processing, from the server’s CPU to the DPU frees up cycles on the OpenShift Container Platform worker nodes to run the applications.
