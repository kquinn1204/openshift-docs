Security hardening is important for protecting edge deployments. NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Kubernetes benchmarks provide the foundation for securing containerized workloads, enforcing zero trust, and ensuring regulatory compliance. To mitigate risks, safeguard critical telecommunications infrastructure, and enhance resilience at the edge, it is vital to align with these security frameworks.

The Compliance Operator running a custom telecommunications security profile, based on NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks, on {product-title}, identified security impacts. Enhancements in {product-version}, primarily implemented using ZTP manifests, are addressing the high-severity issues. The following sections describe the security hardening process issues being addressed.
